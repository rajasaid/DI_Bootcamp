suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding docstrings to each method to explain their purpose and arguments.
- The `__init__` method is currently empty. You could remove it or add initialization logic if needed in the future.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code almost completely follows the instructions. It could be improved by adding input validation in `get_user_menu_choice()` to ensure the user enters a valid number within the expected range (1-3).
- The result update in `main()` directly accesses the dictionary `results` which is okay, but could be more robust by handling potential `KeyError` exceptions (although, since the keys are pre-defined, this isn't strictly necessary).
- The `print_results` function can be improved by using f-strings to make the code more readable.
