suggestions for improvement:
- In the `play` method of the `PetDog` class, you should retrieve the dog's name using `self.name` or `self.get_name()` if you have a getter method. Currently, the code assumes that the `get_name()` method exists.
- The question indicates that the Dog class should be imported from a previous exercise however the solution provided the code for the petdog class and not the dog class in the first place.
- The question indicates that *args on the play method is a list of dog instances however the code assumes its a list of names.
