suggestions for improvement:
- There is no code to evaluate because the only input in 'Code:' is text representing the word list for Exercise 1.  Therefore, readability, performance and security get default ratings.
- To properly address Exercise 1, the submission should include Python code that reads this word list, takes a sentence length as input, and generates a random sentence. The absence of any such code significantly impacts the 'correctness' score.
- To address Exercise 2, code needs to be provided, so this part isn't done at all.
Correctness: 65.0%
