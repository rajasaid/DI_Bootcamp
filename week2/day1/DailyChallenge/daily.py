# Instructions: Old MacDonald’s Farm
#You are given example code and output. Your task is to create a Farm class that produces the same output.
#Step 1: Create the Farm Class
#Create a class called Farm.
#This class will represent a farm and its animals.
#Step 2: Implement the __init__ Method
#The Farm class should have an __init__ method.
#It should take one parameter: farm_name.
#Inside __init__, create two attributes: name to store the farm’s name and animals to store the animals (initialize as an empty dictionary).
#Step 3: Implement the add_animal Method
#Create a method called add_animal.
#It should take two parameters: animal_type and count (with a default value of 1). Count is the quantity of the animal that will be added to the animal dictionary.
#The dictionary will look like this:
#{'cow': 1, 'pig':3, 'horse': 2}
#If the animal_type already exists in the animals dictionary, increment its count by count.
#If it doesn’t exist, add it to the dictionary as the key and with the given count as value.
#Step 4: Implement the get_info Method
#Create a method called get_info.
#It should return a string that displays the farm’s name, the animals and their counts, and the “E-I-E-I-0!” phrase.
#Format the output to match the provided example.
#Use string formatting to align the animal names and counts into columns.
#Step 5: Test Your Code
#Create a Farm object and call the add_animal and get_info methods.
#Verify that the output matches the provided example.

# Step 6: Implement the get_animal_types Method
#Add a method called get_animal_types to the Farm class.
#This method should return a sorted list of all animal types (keys from the animals dictionary).
#Use the sorted() function to sort the list.
#Step 7: Implement the get_short_info Method
#Add a method called get_short_info to the Farm class.
#This method should return a string like “McDonald’s farm has cows, goats and sheeps.”.
#Call the get_animal_types method to get the list of animals.
#Construct the string, adding an “s” to the animal name if its count is greater than 1.
#Use string formatting to create the output.
#Step 8: upgrade the add_animal Method
#use **kwargs for passing multiple animals. The keys will be the animal name and the value will be the quantity.
#Then you can call the method this way: macdonald.add_animal('cow'= 5, 'sheep' = 2, 'goat' = 12)
class Farm:
    def __init__(self, farm_name):
        self.name = farm_name

        info += "E-I-E-I-0!"
        return info

        return sorted(self.animals.keys())

    def get_short_info(self):
        types = self.get_animal_types()
        animal_list = []
        for animal in types:
            if self.animals[animal] > 1:
                animal_list.append(f"{animal}s")
            else:
                animal_list.append(animal)
        short_info = ""        
        if len(animal_list) > 1:
            short_info = ", ".join(animal_list[:-1]) + " and " + animal_list[-1]
        else:
            short_info = animal_list[0]
        return f"{self.name} farm has {short_info}."
# Testing the Farm class
macdonald = Farm("McDonald")
macdonald.add_animal(cow=5, sheep=2, goat=12)
print(macdonald.get_info())
print(macdonald.get_short_info())
# Expected Output:
#McDonald Farm
#cow : 5
#sheep : 2
#goat : 12
#E-I-E-I-0!
#McDonald farm has cows, goats and sheeps.
