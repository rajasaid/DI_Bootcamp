suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding docstrings to each method to explain their purpose and parameters.
- String formatting in get_info could be improved for alignment using string formatting techniques.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements all the requirements from the instructions, including Farm class creation, __init__, add_animal (with kwargs), get_info, get_animal_types, and get_short_info. The output matches the expected output. Therefore, it correctly solves the problem.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. Variable names are descriptive.  Adding docstrings would further improve readability.
- performance: The code uses appropriate data structures (dictionaries) and algorithms (sorting) for efficient operation. The performance is acceptable for the scale of the problem.
- security: The code doesn't interact with any external resources or user inputs, so there are no apparent security concerns.
