suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding docstrings to your classes and methods to improve readability.
- In the Zoo class's `get_groups` method, the printed output is different from the example given in the prompt. Remove the extra print statement in the example.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all four exercises as described in the chapter content. Each class (`Cat`, `Dog`, `Song`, `Zoo`) is correctly defined with the specified attributes and methods. The logic within each method performs the required actions, such as finding the oldest cat, making dogs bark and jump, printing song lyrics, and managing animals in a zoo.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow. Variable names are descriptive, and the code is properly indented. The inclusion of comments explaining each step enhances readability. However, adding docstrings would make the code even easier to understand.
- performance: The code's performance is adequate for the given exercises. The algorithms used are efficient enough for the scale of the problems. No significant performance bottlenecks are apparent.
- security: The code doesn't involve any external input or potentially vulnerable operations, so security is not a major concern. No specific security vulnerabilities are present.
