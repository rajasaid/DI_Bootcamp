suggestions for improvement:
- The input validation could be improved by using a `try-except` block to handle non-integer inputs from the user.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names (e.g., `current_player_symbol` instead of `current_player`).
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the requirements specified in the chapter content. It represents the board, displays it, handles player input, checks for a winner, checks for a tie, and manages the game loop. The logic for each function is correctly implemented, addressing each step outlined in the instructions.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow. The use of functions improves readability. Minor improvements could be made with more descriptive variable names, but overall, it's quite readable.
- performance: The performance is efficient for a simple Tic Tac Toe game. The checks for a winner and a tie are reasonably optimized. The code uses appropriate data structures (lists) for the task.
- security: The code takes integer inputs from the user, but does not handle non integer inputs that may cause an exception. The code itself doesn't directly introduce significant security vulnerabilities within the context of a simple command-line game.
